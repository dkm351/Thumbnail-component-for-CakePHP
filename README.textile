*Attachment component for CakePHP* handles file uploads to the file system. If
it's an image file, it creates thumbnail copies in
@/app/webroot/attachments/photos/{required_sizes}@ folder; while other files
are stored in @/app/webroot/attachments/files@.

I've started it from the public copy at
"@http://sabbour.wordpress.com/2008/07/18/enhanced-image-upload-component-for-cakephp-12/@":http://sabbour.wordpress.com/2008/07/18/enhanced-image-upload-component-for-cakephp-12/
to have a standard way of uploading files to CakePHP projects.


h2. Usage

# Copy @attachment.php@ to @/app/controllers/components/@
# Add component to your controller: @var $components = array('Attachment');@
# In your upload form:
## @echo $form->create('Model', array('type' => 'file'));@
## @echo $form->file('pet'); // pet is the lower case model-name@


h3. Filesystem storage (default)

On version 0.6 the API has evolved to simplify the component usage, with some
new assumptions on the attachments table. We'll asume a Model named 'Pet' for
a sample installation.

The code relies on four columns: @pet_file_path, pet_file_name, pet_file_size@
and @pet_content_type@, which are automagically updated when you call from
the controller *(before @save()@ action)*:

@$this->Attachment->upload($this->data['Pet']);@

You can access the files from the view with the following lines:

Image: @<?= $html->image('/attachments/files_dir/{size}/' . $data['Pet']['pet_file_path']); ?>@
File:  @<?= $html->link('Grab file', '/attachments/files_dir/' . $data['Pet']['pet_file_path']); ?>@

If you are upgrading from v0.5 take note of the following:
* Configuration option @photos_dir@ is now @files_dir@.
* Configuration option @database@ is now @save_in_db@.
* You may need to tweak your database schema (not necessarily though).

If you used default options the upgrade may be seamless.

h3. Database storage (not working right now)

# Change @$config['database'] = true@ in attachment.php.
# In your controller action:
  @$binary_data = $this->Attachment->upload($this->data['Model']['Attachment']);@
# Save @$binary_data@ to database binary column:
  @$this->data['Model']['file_contents'] = $binary_data;@

h2. Configuration options (default values between parentheses)

* @files_dir@: Where to save the files (inside @/app/webroot/attachments/@) (@photos@).
* @rm_tmp_file@: Remove temporal image after resizing (@false@).
* @save_in_db@: Save the images in the database or the filesystem (@false@).
* @allow_non_image_files@, self descriptive ;-) (@true@).
* @default_col@: Column prefix for file related data (lowercase modelname).
* @images_size@: Array of different file sizes required by your app. Each
  element is itself an array, like:
    @'folder_name' => array($width, $height, $do_crop)@.

You can override the default configuration passing an array of options while
including the component, like:
@var $components = array('Attachment' => array(
	'files_dir' => 'pets',
	'images_size' => array(
		'avatar'  => array(75, 75, true)
	)
));@

h2. Methods

h3. upload($data)

* @data@: raw data from form. If it's an image, it calls:

h3. thumbnail($data, $upload_dir, $maxw, $maxh, $crop = false)

* @data@: image data array
* @upload_dir@: where to save the file (inside @attachments/files_dir@)
* @maxw/maxh@: maximum width/height for resizing images
* @crop@: Crop image? (defaults to @false@)

h3. delete_files($filename)

* @filename@: file-to-delete name

h2. Requirements

* PHP GD library installed and enabled
* @/app/webroot/attachments/@ must be writable by the web server.

h2. To do list

* Show options for not resizing (or scaling with only one value) images.
* Make @$do_crop@ a string instead of a bool to let it use the three options.
* For database uploading:
** Do image resizing.
** Option to show or download database files.
